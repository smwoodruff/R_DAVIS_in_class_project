set.seed(15)
hw3 <- runif(50, 4, 50)
hw3 <- replace(hw3, c(4,12,22,27), NA)
hw3

#PROBLEM 1:
#Take you hw3 vector and remove all the NAs then select all the numbers between 14 and 38 inclusive, call this vector prob1.

class(hw3)

#This just removed all of the NAs amd defined the new vector as hw3.1 
hw3.1 <- hw3[complete.cases(hw3)]
hw3.1

#This chose numbers between 14 and 38 and then named that set of numbers as a new vector defined as prob1
prob1 <- hw3.1[hw3.1 >14 & hw3.1 <38]


#PROBLEM 2:
#Multiply each number in the prob1 vector by 3 to create a new vector called times3. Then add 10 to each number in your times3 vector to create a new vector called plus10.

3*prob1
times3 <- 3*prob1

10 + times3
plus10 <- (10 + times3)


#PROBLEM 3:
#Select every other number in your plus10 vector by selecting the first number, not the second, the third, not the fourth, etc. If youâ€™ve worked through these three problems in order, you should now have a vector that is 12 numbers long that looks exactly like this one:

plus10
plus10[seq(1, length(plus10), 2)]
final <- plus10[seq(1, length(plus10), 2)]

#Can also do...
final.2 <- plus10[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
final.2
